In this Question we are given two integers K and N. we have to find the combinations of integer sum,
till the size of k. 
First of all we can calculate the sum of integers form 1 to k and if sum is greater than or equal to n
then there is a possibility of finding any possible solution, otherwise there is no possible combination.

if there is any combination is possible combinations then we will find them with the help of backtracking,
in the recursive function we will find the different sum of integers from 1 to 10 digits and then add the digits 
in the list and if the list sum is equal to n then we will add it in the main arraylist.
